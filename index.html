									<p>In this dashboard, we cleaned the data and then created different measures using DAX.
										<br>  We finally got a report that has different insights within the organization: 
										<br> - The total number of employees and how many of them are females and males. 
										<br> - Service years for the employees. 
										<br> - Distance status from work in order to understand the employees situations. 
									    <br> - The number and percentage of employees who are qualified for promotion and aren't qualified yet. 
										<br> - The number and percentage of employees who are on service and the employees that unfortunately will be letting go.</p>
